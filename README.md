# digit-detection
## Draws bounding boxes around detected digits

It can detect digits and put a bounding box around the detected digits.

Currently, the network is trained on 105 samples of the digit '1' from the mnist dataset.

I don't think it is working well, just overfitting the data. It is just predicting around the coordinates (8, 2) and (19, 24).

I will label more data, of other digits too, and then I will retrain the model to see how well it works.
